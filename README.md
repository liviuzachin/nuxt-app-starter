# NuxtJS App Starter

This is a SPA/SSR/SSG VueJS/Nuxt application boilerplate created via `yarn create nuxt-app` to get you started with this awesome framework. NuxtJS is an MIT licensed open source project and completely free to use. It comes with some amazing modules like Axios, PWA, Tailwind and [more](https://modules.nuxtjs.org/).

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
